# JavaWarBot
Java tool for creation and execution of country war-bots.

## What's this?
This java app is designed to simulate a war-bot's behaviour. Given a map, users can draw polygons on it representing localities, give them a name and a goverment, and set their frontiers.
Once the map is ready, a war simulation can be launched with the bottom set of buttons. Localities will conquer each other by steps, expanding it's government across other zones.

## Default map
By default, the program uses a Spain political map. This serves as an example, but users can load any map as an image and draw on it to configure its geopolitical zones.

## Save and restore the simulation
There's functionality allowing users to save and load simulations and maps as .txt files that are easily edited by hand. Keep in mind, you still need to keep the map image file.
